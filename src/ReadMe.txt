Submission Date: 16 November 2023
Changes have been made to the following files:
- Shape: Added A, D, S, Shiny variables that correpond to the shape's material color.
- Camera: (1) Added the depth buffer. (2) The CreatePixelColor() now can create shadows and can now add Ambient/Diffuse/Specular color. Note: For readability, I did not use the At() function - this has no effect on the performance.
